# Diabetic Retinopathy

_Diabetic retinopathy is a diabetes complication that affects eyes. It's caused by damage to the blood vessels of the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye (retina)._

Diabetic retinopathy is usually classified into 5 categories
1. No Diabetic Retinopathy
2. Mild Diabetic Retinopathy
3. Moderate Diabetic Retinopathy
4. Severe Diabetic Retinopathy
5. Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy

# Approach
We aim to build a deep learning model to predict to stage of Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) in a patient with just a scan of the eye. We employ various image augmentation techniques and implement a Convolutional Neural Network based model to classify eye scans into their respectivee DR categories.
